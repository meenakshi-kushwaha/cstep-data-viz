## Do cars with big engines use more fuel than cars with small engines?

---
# Data set `mpg`

Observations collected by US EPA on 38 models of cars

```{r}
head(ggplot2::mpg)
```

- `displ` : car's engine size

- `hwy` : car's fuel efficiency on the highway in miles per gallon

- type `?mpg` to learn more about the dataset

???
a car with low fuel efficiency consumes more fuel than a car with high fuel efficiency for the same distance

# Common Problems

- Make sure that every `(` is matched with a `)` 

- Make sure that every `"` is paired with another `"`

- Make sure you use `+` and not `%>%`

- Make sure that `+` is in the right place: it has to come at the end of the line, not the start. The following code will **not work**

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg) 
+ geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

- Look for help by typing `?function_name`
  - scroll down to examples
  
- Look at the error message  
  - *try googling the error message*

As you start to run R code, you’re likely to run into problems. Don’t worry — it happens to everyone. I have been writing R code for years, and every day I still write code that doesn’t work! Start by carefully comparing the code that you’re running to the code in the book. R is extremely picky, and a misplaced character can make all the difference.

# Quiz

What is the minimum requirement to make a plot using `ggplot()`?

1. data, scales, theme  
2. data, facets, geometries  
3. data, statistics, coordinates  
4. data, mapping, geometries  

---
# Quiz

Which of this is correct syntax for `ggplot()`?

a) `ggplot(data = mpg)` 
`+ geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))`

b) `ggplot(data = mpg) + ` 
`geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))`

c) `ggplot(data = mpg) %>%`
` geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))`

d) `ggplot(data = mpg)`
` geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))`


---
####*Let's look at the plot again*

![](images/cars.png)
---
```{r my_cars3, include = FALSE, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data=mpg)+ #BREAK
  aes(x=displ)+#BREAK
  aes(y=hwy)+#BREAK
  aes(color=class)+ #BREAK2
  geom_point() #BREAK
                 
```

`r chunk_reveal("my_cars3", break_type = "non_seq", title="#Aesthetics")`

---
```{r my_cars4, include = FALSE, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data=mpg)+ #BREAK
  aes(x=displ)+#BREAK
  aes(y=hwy)+#BREAK
  aes(shape=class)+ #BREAK2
  geom_point() #BREAK
                 
```

# Aesthetics
Setting the properties of `geom` manually
```{r fig.height=4}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue") #<<
```

--

Here, the color "blue" doesn’t convey information about a variable, but only changes the appearance of the plot
---
# Aesthetics

To set a geometric property manually, place it outside of `aes()`

- The name of a color as a character string

- The size of a point in mm

- The shape of a point as a number

Both plots have the same `x` and `y` axes but use different `geoms` or geometries

Plots are often described as their geoms as boxplots, line plots, etc.

  geom_point() + #BREAK2
  geom_smooth()

```
`r chunk_reveal("geoms2", break_type = "auto", title="##Mulitple geoms")`
???
If you place mappings in a geom function, ggplot2 will treat them as local mappings for the layer. It will use these mappings to extend or overwrite the global mappings for that layer only. This makes it possible to display different aesthetics in different layers.
---
```{r geoms3, include=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg, 
       mapping = aes(
         x = displ, 
         y = hwy)) + #BREAK
  geom_point(
    mapping = aes(
      color = class)) + #BREAK2
  geom_smooth()

```
`r chunk_reveal("geoms3", break_type = "auto", title="##Mulitple geoms")`
---
##Where to place `aes()`

- If `aes()` function is placed inside ggplot(), the same `aes` is used for all layers

- If `aes()` is placed outside ggplot() function then its definition is used for the specific layer

- Multiple `aes()` can be defined for multiple geometries within the same plot
---
```{r geoms4, include=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg,
       mapping = aes(
         x = displ, 
         y = hwy)) + #BREAK 
  geom_point(
    mapping = aes(
      color = class)) + #BREAK2
  geom_smooth(data = 
                filter(mpg, 
                       class == "suv"), 
              se = FALSE) 

```

Which of the following is NOT true?

1. If `aes()` function is placed inside `ggplot()`, the same aes is used for all layers

2. If `aes()` is placed outside  `ggplot()` function then its definition is used for the specific layer

3. Multiple `aes()` can be defined for multiple geometries within the same plot

4. Variables or columns to be plotted can be placed outside `aes()`
